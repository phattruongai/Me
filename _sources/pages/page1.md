> This is my graduation project about the tomato classification system. This project includes 3 part described below and the source code can be found at [Github](https://github.com/phattruongai/Tomato-classification-system)

### 1. Core classification model (Convolutional neural network combined with Grad-CAM visualization):

<!-- * [Tutorial]() -->

### 2. PCB and circuit diagram:
